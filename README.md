# Stock-Forecasting-with-Machine-Learning

Deployed a Gradient Boosting model that generated a 7x lift in ROI vs baseline â€” proving machine learning isn't just theoretical, it's profitable.

## ğŸ”¬ Model Benchmarking

This project tested every mainstream model for forecasting market Direction]:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks (MLP/Keras)
- Gradient Boosting

> **Result:** Gradient Boosting delivered **7x higher ROI** on the holdout dataset vs average baseline.

### ğŸ“ˆ Why Gradient Boosting Won:
- Handles feature interactions automatically
- Deals with non-linearity & noise better
- Outperformed even MLP in limited-data setting
